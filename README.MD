Fenix - 2D Framework with it's own GUI and Physics I've written around 2003, written in pure C++ and DirectX 9.

This is very old code (12+ years) and completely un-edited code I recently dug up from some old DVD's I found in my old room. Don't use as example of best practices. Open sourcing for possible Educational value.
